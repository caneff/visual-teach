// Address PR review comments — a standalone CLI.
//
// For each PR it spins up a sandbox that checks out the PR branch, addresses
// the unresolved review comments, pushes the fixes back to the same branch
// (updating the open PR in place), and replies to each thread.
//
// Reply-only: it does NOT resolve threads and does NOT merge. You review the
// replies and resolve/merge yourself.
//
// Sandboxes authenticate with the `.env` PAT Sandcastle forwards as a file; host
// `gh`/`git` calls here use your ambient credential. No bot identity (#245/#250).
//
// Usage:
//   npx tsx .sandcastle/address.mts <pr-number> [<pr-number> ...]  # specific PRs
//   npx tsx .sandcastle/address.mts                                # sweep open sandcastle PRs with comments
