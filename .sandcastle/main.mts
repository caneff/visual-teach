// Parallel Planner with Review — dependency-forest orchestration loop
//
// This template drives a multi-phase workflow:
//   Phase 1 (Plan):             An opus agent analyzes open issues, builds a
//                               dependency graph, and outputs a <plan> JSON
//                               listing unblocked issues with branch names AND
//                               the `parents` each one builds on.
//   Phase 2 (Execute + Review): For each issue, a sandbox is created via
//                               createSandbox(), cut from its RESOLVED BASE — its
//                               parent's branch when it has one present this run,
//                               otherwise `main`. Chains are independent off main
//                               (the forest); a child branch carries its parent's
//                               commits but never an unrelated chain's. The
//                               implementer runs first (100 iterations); if
//                               there's work on the branch a reviewer runs in the
//                               same sandbox (1 iteration). All issue pipelines
//                               run concurrently via Promise.allSettled().
//   Phase 3 (Open PRs):         The host splits the run's completed issues into
//                               connected dependency components and opens ONE PR
//                               per component: it merges each component's leaf
//                               tips into a throwaway head off `main`,
//                               force-pushes it, and an agent opens the PR into
//                               main for manual review (no auto-merge).
//
// The outer loop repeats up to MAX_ITERATIONS times. Because a completed issue's
// branch is immutable and the next iteration's dependent branches are cut from
// it directly (base resolution), an issue blocked by an earlier one is picked up
// and built on top once the earlier one lands — instead of deadlocking until a
// human merges. There is no single integration tip and no per-issue fold: the
// forest replaces the former one revisable stack.
//
// PRs are split by PR set (one run → several PRs): a connected component of
// dependency edges, with independent same-topic components combined via a `group`
// key the planner emits. A multi-parent (diamond) issue is built on a temp base
// branch merging all its parents.
//
// Usage:
//   npx tsx .sandcastle/main.mts
