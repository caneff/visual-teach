// Parallel Planner with Review — one PR per issue, one planning pass per run
//
// This template drives a single-pass workflow:
//   Phase 1 (Plan):             An opus agent reads the host-computed buildable
//                               frontier and outputs a <plan> JSON of the issues
//                               to build concurrently, pruned for implicit
//                               same-file conflicts.
//   Phase 2 (Execute + Review): For each issue, a sandbox is created via
//                               createSandbox(), cut from `main`. The implementer
//                               runs first; if there's work on the branch, two
//                               read-only judges (Spec + Standards) run in the
//                               same sandbox, committing nothing. All issue
//                               pipelines run concurrently via
//                               Promise.allSettled().
//   Phase 3 (Outcome):          Each issue's terminal outcome is applied inline.
//                               A clean pass opens ONE ready PR from the issue's
//                               own branch into `main` and labels it in-review in
//                               the same step. A two-axis review-fail is binding:
//                               no PR, the branch is preserved and the failure is
//                               written into the issue body for a human.
//
// One planning pass per run: nothing merges to `main` mid-run, so there is no
// second pass to re-select an in-review issue through GitHub's index lag. A
// dependency chain drains one level per run-until-empty pass (`/sandcastle-watch`),
// each gated by a human merge — that outer drain is the only loop.
//
// Usage:
//   npx tsx .sandcastle/main.mts
// Or add to package.json:
//   "scripts": { "sandcastle": "npx tsx .sandcastle/main.mts" }
