# TASK

The review of branch {{BRANCH}} failed. Fix exactly the findings below, commit
the fixes to {{BRANCH}}, and stop. There is no PR yet — do NOT open, push, or
touch one.

# ORIENT

You are already on {{BRANCH}} — this sandbox checked it out in an isolated
worktree. Confirm with `git branch --show-current`. Every commit you make stays
on this branch. Do NOT create a new branch, do NOT push, do NOT open a PR.

# THE FINDINGS

These are the reviewers' failure notes for this branch — each a concrete defect a
judge blocked on (a citation to redirect, a stale comment to delete, a duplicated
helper to factor, a misplaced definition to move, a small spec gap to close).
Address every one.

{{FINDINGS}}

</review-findings>

# SCOPE

Stay inside the findings. Make the change each one asks for and nothing else. Do
NOT refactor unrelated code, re-do work the branch already did, or re-open the
ticket's design. The branch was otherwise accepted; you are closing the gap the
review named, not rebuilding.

If a finding is genuinely unclear, or you believe it is wrong, do NOT guess. Fix
the ones you can and leave that finding's code as-is — the re-review catches it
and escalates to a human. A wrong "fix" is worse than a skipped one.

# VERIFY, COMMIT

1. Run `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test`. It must pass.
2. Stage everything and commit — use `git add -A`, not `git commit -am`, so a NEW
   file a fix added still reaches the branch:
   `git add -A && git commit -m "Address review findings on {{BRANCH}}"`.
   (The pre-commit hook re-runs lint/format/tests — let it.)

Do NOT push. Do NOT open, touch, or merge a PR. The orchestrator re-reviews the
branch and decides what happens next.

Once every finding you can address has a fix and the branch is committed, output
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
