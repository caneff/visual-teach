# TASK

The review of branch {{BRANCH}} failed. Fix exactly the findings below, commit
the fixes to {{BRANCH}}, and stop. There is no PR yet — do NOT open, push, or
touch one.

# ORIENT

You are already on {{BRANCH}} — this sandbox checked it out in an isolated
worktree. Confirm with `git branch --show-current`. Every commit you make stays
on this branch. Do NOT create a new branch, do NOT push, do NOT open a PR.

# THE FINDINGS

These are the reviewers' failure notes for this branch — each a concrete defect a
judge blocked on (a citation to redirect, a stale comment to delete, a duplicated
helper to factor, a misplaced definition to move, a small spec gap to close).
Address every one.

<review-findings>

{{FINDINGS}}

</review-findings>

# SCOPE

Stay inside the findings. Make the change each one asks for and nothing else. Do
NOT refactor unrelated code, re-do work the branch already did, or re-open the
ticket's design. The branch was otherwise accepted; you are closing the gap the
review named, not rebuilding.

If a finding is genuinely unclear, or you believe it is wrong, do NOT guess. Fix
the ones you can and leave that finding's code as-is — the re-review catches it
and escalates to a human. A wrong "fix" is worse than a skipped one.

# VERIFY, COMMIT

1. Run `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test`. It must pass.
2. Stage everything and commit — use `git add -A`, not `git commit -am`, so a NEW
   file a fix added still reaches the branch:
   `git add -A && git commit -m "Address review findings on {{BRANCH}}"`.
   (The pre-commit hook re-runs lint/format/tests — let it.)

Do NOT push. Do NOT open, touch, or merge a PR. The orchestrator re-reviews the
branch and decides what happens next.

# LEDGER

Before you finish, account for every finding. The findings above are numbered
by their reviewer(s) — you may receive two numbered runs (spec starting at 1,
then standards starting at 1), in that order. List each distinct finding from
the reports above on its own line, citing its number, in this form:

- [fixed]   #2 <short name of the finding>
- [skipped] #1 <short name of the finding> — <one-line reason you left it>

Split finely: two separate defects are two rows, even under one heading. Every
numbered finding, every `file:line`, and every distinct defect in the reports
must appear as a row, including ones you left exactly as they were — reproduce
the numbers in the order given. Then, on its own line, confirm:
"Every finding above is a row."

Only after the branch is committed and the ledger and that confirmation line
are written, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
