/**
 * Sandbox plumbing shared by every sandbox creation site (`main.mts` and

 *
 * No token minting and no bot git identity: every sandbox authenticates with the
 * `.env` PAT that Sandcastle forwards into it as a file. (Distinct bot authorship
 * lived here once — a GitHub App minting flow — and is recoverable from git; see
 * Spec #240 for the cut-commit SHA.)

/**
 * The `onSandboxReady` command list.
 *
 * Sandcastle runs `onSandboxReady` hooks with unbounded concurrency, and every
 * `git config` write takes an exclusive `.git/config.lock` on the bind-mounted
 * host `.git`. So the hooks-path isolation write must be the ONLY `git config`
 * entry, or a second one would race it and the loser dies with "could not lock
 * config file: File exists" (issue #52). `mkdir` doesn't touch the lock, so its
 * position in the chain is harmless.
 *
 * Hook-path isolation: the host `.git` (carrying the host pre-commit hook) is
 * mounted in, but pre-commit isn't on the container PATH, so a plain commit
 * dies; pointing `core.hooksPath` at an empty dir disables it in-sandbox. The
 * Phase-3 check gate runs the same linters anyway.
